ESD methodology combines physical techniques and psychological/emotional skills for personal and inner development; it helps build healthy interpersonal relationships, increase self-confidence and assertiveness, and prevent various forms of violence. Simultaneously this program focuses on education on issues related to gender-based violence and gender stereotypes, the right to defend oneself and to have a safe and healthy life."
