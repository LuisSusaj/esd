  "text": "Empowerment Self Defense is a system of learning how to avoid danger, de-escalate conflict, increase self-efficacy in problem solving, and build physical self-defense skills. ESD is different from a martial art in a few ways. Its foundation is built upon understanding the history, psychology, and pathos of violence against women and vulnerable populations. Also, ESD focuses first on the adage: the best conflict is one avoided, thus recognizing potential conflict and de-escalating are key tools. ESDâ€™s physical training techniques are based on the expectation that the person attacked is smaller than the attacker. Finally, ESD, while taught to individuals, includes community building and advocacy as a pillar of its teaching."
