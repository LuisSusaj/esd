Our Summer Camp is a collaborative space where ESD experts and instructors are welcomed to join and share. We will organize skill-sharing sessions facilitated by international ESD instructors Sarah Gordon Lavine and Gentiana Susaj. In addition, there will be a space for discussion and networking. The goal is for us to come together as a community, to share success and struggles, generate networking for future collaborations and programs. At ESD Global Europe, we believe in the power of sharing and learning from each other, supporting and networking to make violence prevention education accessible to all. This event is organized by ESD Albania in cooperation with UN Women in the framework of the UN Joint Program “Ending Violence against Women” funded by the Government of Sweden.
