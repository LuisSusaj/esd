Two years later, after piloting its program “Self Defense for Safety and Wellbeing”, the first instructor achieved certification as an ESD Instructor Level 1 from ESD Global. Since then, we've been at the forefront of promoting ESD in Albania and in Europe, collaborating with ESD Global Self Defense and IMPACT Personal Safety Global and SoCal. Our mission is to educate for violence prevention by challenging stereotypes and fostering healthy relationships through personal safety and self-defense techniques for empowerment. We are proud partners with esteemed global and regional organizations, UN agencies, and networks of self defense instructors and educators, dedicated to violence prevention. ",
